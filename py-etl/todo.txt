- extract unit symbol, type
- extract location elevation ("ele") and waypoints
- extract environment website

- sequence analyses

- write a tool that fills in missing metadata (tags, units) for "blank"/renamed streams 

  1. identify env/stream IDs
  - how can we find them? e.g. all streams without tags, units:
    (this is where it helps that we store empty strings as tags, units)
    cosm=# select count(distinct s.id) from stream s where unit is null;
     count 
    -------
      2459

    cosm=# select count(distinct s.id) from stream s left outer join stream_tags st on s.id=st.stream_id where st.tag_id is null;
     count 
    -------
      2459

  2. identify period
  - oldest associated data point

  3. find XML, parse, update

- query performance optimisation: postgres table partitions
  - http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/ddl-partitioning.html
  - set up inheriting tables for each month of data 
    - with check constraints on "updated"
    - with index on "updated"
    - use the same sequence for all child tables http://www.neilconway.org/docs/sequences/
  - set up an insert trigger on master table that re-routes inserts based on "updated"
