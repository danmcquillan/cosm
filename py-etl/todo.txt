- extract unit symbol, type
- extract location elevation ("ele") and waypoints
- extract environment website

- write a tool that fills in missing metadata (tags, units) for "blank"/renamed streams 

  1. identify env/stream IDs
  - how can we find them? e.g. all streams without tags, units:
    (this is where it helps that we store empty strings as tags, units)
    cosm=# select count(distinct s.id) from stream s where unit is null;
     count 
    -------
      2459

    cosm=# select count(distinct s.id) from stream s left outer join stream_tags st on s.id=st.stream_id where st.tag_id is null;
     count 
    -------
      2459

  2. identify period
  - oldest associated data point

  3. find XML, parse, update

- sequence analyses
